Spectre provides various enhancements for SSP. These enhancements may be turned off at any time by opening the plugin's menu and toggling it off. Simply right click a ghost, go to the plugins tab, click on Spectre, and you will see Spectre's menu.

Note that it is recommended to use the balloon "Ghost Balloon" while using this plugin.

Spectre's enhancements are improved by calibrating the plugin for each ghost. Which ghost Spectre will calibrate depends on which ghost you open the plugin menu with. (Note: for ghosts with custom calibration, you still need to open Spectre's menu with them at least once! Doing so should complete the calibration automatically.)

Ghosts that have not yet been calibrated will have a calibration button on the main menu. Ghosts that have already been calibrated may be recalibrated at any time from the plugin's settings menu.

If you are a ghost developer, you can provide a custom calibration for your ghost. This will complete calibration automatically when the user opens the plugin's menu to provide an easier experience for the user, and it will allow you to maximize your ghost's compatbility. Once you have spent some time using the plugin and are familiar with its effects, check the information in dev_info.txt!
